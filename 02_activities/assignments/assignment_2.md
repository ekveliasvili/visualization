# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
The bad one is http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2016/05/the-guardian-puts-flow-charts-on-map.html

I picked the above plot due to some reasons: In my personal opinion the visualization does not look aesthetic and also is not perceptual as I am not sure I understand what the author was trying to convey. It's quite difficult to draw the conclusions by looking at this data visualization. And unless the audience which was supposed to use this viz is well aware and educated about the topic it is not developed for the general public.
The author used a very rare type of chart as it bears much more cognitive load for the person.
Bright colours are easy to distinguish but because of the number of blocks it does look overwhelming and add on even more cognitive load on the viewer. The blocks are not labelled that is why it‚Äôs not completely clear what they represent, my assumption that it does represent the number of seats but I am not sure. Also, there is no explanation on why the blocks are stacked the way they are because the axis are not labeled either. Little legend in the right upper corner provides some information to users but it does not explain why lines intersects and under what conditions
Even though the blocks are stacked in some specific order, the visualization itself does not provide any comparison (but legend explains that each block represents data from 2011 through 2016)
And despite the fact that the name of the diagram is provided, I did not understand how exactly the geography has changed over the course of 5 years 

The good one is https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bigxpt/viz/SERVICEMANAGEMENT/design
 I pick this one because of the several reasons:
1. It‚Äôs 2D visualization which consists of the most common graphs and therefore decreases the cognitive load. It allows a viewer to focus on the data itself. 
2. The author uses clean layout and geometrical shapes and lines.
3. Colours are picked up correctly so that the increase is green conveying positive changes. Project statistics graph is well colour coded as green is usually perceived as a good sign whereas red is perceived as something negative
Even though colouring used in this design is not neutral in general and the author is trying to show some positive outcomes I personally find it to be appealing rather than adversing.
4. The labels and titles are used for each visualization and explain the information depicted on it.
5. Because the authors used the clean and plain design and descriptions - graphs can be easily perceived by general public. 

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      First I would like to start with the good visualization and describe how i would improve it. As I mentioned previously I like the colours which author picked for this viz. However, if we try to convey data as neutral as possible without layering our position to the audience. 
      The graph called ‚ÄúNew Users‚Äù slightly confuses even though it‚Äôs titled, labelled and legends are provided. The Y-axis on both sides refers to different scales and such not clear which one is correct. 
      I would also added the souce of the data on the bottom of the visualization. 


      Speaking of the bad example I would liek to suggest some improvments:
      1. Geographic charts are somewhat complex and confusing so if I still pick to use I would try to label axis and provide more informatipon on the chart explaning how to read it. We would need to balance the quantity of info on a chart to avoid to overcrowd it.
      2. Improve colours used in this chart since it is too bright and take propbaly more attention that the viz itself is trying to express. Ideally we still would like to use contrast colours but not so bright.
      3. Try to simplify the chart or maybe even splitting into several charts so that it can be consumed gradually
      4. The proportion of the period (2011-2016) can be enlarged becuse it looks congested somewhat non important.  
      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
